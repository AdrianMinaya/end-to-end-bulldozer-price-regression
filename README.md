# End-to-end-bulldozer-price-regression
This project focuses on building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict the sale price of used bulldozers using historical auction data. It was inspired by a real-world dataset from the Blue Book for Bulldozers competition on Kaggle, where the goal is to model how various features influence bulldozer prices over time.
